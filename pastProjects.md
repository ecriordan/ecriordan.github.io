## Ecological Restoration for Climate Change
Land managers are grappling with how to restore degraded wildland habitats in the context of unprecedented environmental change. In southern California, native habitats are heavily impacted by habitat fragmentation, invasive species, disruption of dispersal processes and biotic interactions, and human caused disturbance and altered fire regimes. Warming temperatures and increasingly severe droughts are compounding are pushing plants to their physiological limits. Increasinlgy, land managers are finding themselves in unfamiliar territory. Will tried and true tenets, such as local seed sourcing, lose effectiveness as the rate of climate change surpasses the adaptive capacity of plants? Could moving plants too far and too soon in anticipation of future conditions create maladapted populations? How do we select the right plants for the right place at the right time to promote resilient landscapes? I used species distribution modeling to project climate-driven changes in suitable habitat for 44 important southern California plant taxa. These projections were incorporated into [native plant profiles](https://www.rcrcd.org/native-plant-materials-program) that fill a critical need for information to guide plant material sourcing for ecological restoration and re-vegetation projects. The plant profiles, developed by the [Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation District](https://www.rcrcd.org/) and [USFS Pacific Southwest Research Station](https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/), contain ecological, taxonomic, distribution, and genetic information to assist land managers in selecting appropriate species and locations for seed collection and plantings.
