Land managers are grappling with how to restore degraded wildland habitats in the context of unprecedented environmental change. In southern California, native habitats are heavily impacted by habitat fragmentation, invasive species, disruption of dispersal processes and biotic interactions, and human caused disturbance and altered fire regimes. Warming temperatures and increasingly severe droughts are compounding are pushing plants to their physiological limits. Increasinlgy, land managers are finding themselves in unfamiliar territory. Will tried and true tenets, such as local seed sourcing, lose effectiveness as the rate of climate change surpasses the adaptive capacity of plants? Could moving plants too far and too soon in anticipation of future conditions create maladapted populations? How do we select the right plants for the right place at the right time to promote resilient landscapes? I used species distribution modeling to project climate-driven changes in suitable habitat for 44 important southern California plant taxa. These projections were incorporated into [native plant profiles](https://www.rcrcd.org/native-plant-materials-program) that fill a critical need for information to guide plant material sourcing for ecological restoration and re-vegetation projects. The plant profiles, developed by the [Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation District](https://www.rcrcd.org/) and [USFS Pacific Southwest Research Station](https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/), contain ecological, taxonomic, distribution, and genetic information to assist land managers in selecting appropriate species and locations for seed collection and plantings.

## Role of Protected Areas in a Changing Climate
Climate change is testing the role of protected areas for biodiversity conservation. Protected areas have long been a critical tool for conservation, commonly delimited with respect to specific ecosystems and rare or threatened species. Yet, these conservation targets are dynamic with complex responses to the environment. As climate change drives range shifts and extinctions of target species, the role of protected areas may need to adapt. I investigated the effect of projected climate change on the role of the University of California’s Natural Reserve System (NRS) for rare plant conservation. The NRS was originally established in 1965 to provide natural environments for research, education, and public service. It has since expanded to an extensive network of 41 reserves that is the world’s largest university operated reserve system.

Historically, the NRS has played a key role protecting California’s numerous rare plants. NRS reserves comprise less than 1% of the state’s total land area yet represent 16% or more of the state’s over 2,300 rare plants. Climate change, however, will likely require stronger trans-boundary and cross-jurisdictional cooperation for effective rare plant conservation. Species distribution models predict that climate change will create unsuitable conditions for many rare plants across the state and within NRS reserves by the end of the century. While habitat losses will negatively affect species representation within individual NRS reserves, many species will maintain and even gain habitat in other reserves within the larger NRS network or in adjacent open spaces. Effectively managing species redistributions will be complex, likely requiring integration of social and ecological disciplines. The legacies of research, stewardship, and diverse stakeholder engagement of the NRS specifically, and biological field stations in general, well-position these institutions to lead the way forward in adapting biodiversity conservation to a new era of unprecedented change.
