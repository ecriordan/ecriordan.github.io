## Ecological Restoration for Climate Change
Southern Californiaâ€™s wildlands are being degraded by habitat fragmentation, disruption of dispersal processes and biotic interactions, human caused disturbance, and human altered fire regimes. Climate change brings additional challenges. Warming temperatures and increasingly severe droughts are compounding these stressors and are pushing the physiological limits of plants. For these reasons, land managers are grappling with how to select the right plants for the right place at the right time to restore degraded wildland habitats. Will tried and true tenets, such as local seed sourcing, lose effectiveness as the rate of climate change threatens to exceed the adaptive capacity of plant species? Could moving plants too far and too soon in anticipation of future conditions create maladapted populations? I used species distribution modeling to project climate-driven changes in suitable habitat for 44 important southern California plant taxa. These projections were incorporated into [native plant profiles](https://www.rcrcd.org/native-plant-materials-program) that fill a critical need for information to guide plant material sourcing for ecological restoration and re-vegetation projects. The plant profiles, developed by the [Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation District](https://www.rcrcd.org/) and [USFS Pacific Southwest Research Station](https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/), contain ecological, taxonomic, distribution, and genetic information to assist land managers in selecting appropriate species and locations for seed collection and plantings.
