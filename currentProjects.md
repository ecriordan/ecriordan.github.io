## Scaling forest climate sensitivity 
Increasingly, scientists are using tree growth–climate relationships quantified from tree-ring data to project climate change impacts on forests. Local tree-ring measurements are often aggregated to produce an average time-series that is representative of a larger region. This process of data aggregation enhances the common climate signal in tree-ring time series while dampening individualistic growth patterns such that climate emerges as a strong predictor of variability in tree ring-widths, particularly at broad spatial scales. The fine-scale variability in tree growth lost with aggregation, however, contains important clues about forest resilience. For example, locations where trees are relatively insensitive to climate may point to underlying processes buffering forests from climate change and possible refugia. Conversely, trees whose growth is highly sensitive to climate may act as canaries in the coal mine, alerting forest managers to vulnerable areas already under climate stress. I investigate how widely-used aggregation practices affect estimates of tree growth sensitivity to climate and their implications when managing forests for resilience to climate change.

## Adapting agriculture for a hotter, drier world 
Without profound changes in current food production and arable land management practices, we face widespread hunger in a hotter future [IPCC 2019](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/). Arid zones are on the frontlines of the climate change food security crisis, already experiencing imminent threats to water availability, ecosystem services, economic security, and human health. I focus on the Sonoran Desert as a laboratory for the future, drawing upon the region’s native ecosystems and traditional knowledge to advance climate adaptation solutions for arid land food systems. As part of a diverse transdisciplinary team integrating plant, environmental, social, and health sciences, I evaluate the potential of Sonoran Desert plants as new crops for arid-adapted agriculture. When integrated into polycultures, desert plants have the capacity to improve agroecological and human health and resilience.
